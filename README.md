# Weighted_Histogram_Analysis_Method
 - MATLAB and PYTHON code for unbiasing MCMC umbrella sampling simulations using Weighted Histogram Analysis Method
 - I have also provided a code to carry out simple umbrella sampling simulations using a 1D probability distribution. This is a double well model potential.
